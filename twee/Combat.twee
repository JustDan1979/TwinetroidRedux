I jump, spin like a top, and ram into the Rio'a Screw Attack!

Powerful energy envelops my entire body, diffusing as I strike and damaging my opponent. The Screw Attack's power has enough force to defeat all enemies in a single hit. However, it requires great skill to successfully guide my body while spinning, and its drawback is there are many ways to fail.

This time the attack succeeds beautifully.

<img src="assets/images/Rio.webp">The Rio is a creature resembling an enormous moth. The creature's length when it spreads its wings is 1.15 meters, and it swoops down to attack with its enormous talons. The Rio flies through the air with its wings and uses its talons almost entirely in its attacks. The Rio's attack method is also simple: it swoops down at high speed and strikes with its large talons.

However, if my only means of attack is the Normal Beam, this is not an opponent to make light of. As for the Rio's Command Level, Level II may be one step above the Geemer, the weakest enemy, but it's better to proceed with caution at first.

Given my current status, choose whether I should fight the Rio now.

The Sidehopper's next attack has enough force to stop my movement instantly. And, the creature doesn't miss. The Sidehopper's next strike damages my legs with a direct hit. Given my current state of immobility, this attack has more than double the power of the previous one. As a result, my legs are completely paralyzed. 

My legs may have been modified with multiple cyborg enhancements, but they have become brittle after so much damage has been loaded onto them. Now that I am unable to move, the Sidehopper inflicts a series of consecutive attacks.

However, this attack missed. My prediction of the Doublehopper's move was wrong. Although I simply confused left with right, I actually take a large amount of damage.

:: Scan Geruda {"position":"475,2975","size":"100,100"}
The Geruda is much stronger than the Geemer and Rio. The creature converts the incredible amount of energy given off by its body into blistering heat and constantly emits high body temperatures. Furthermore, the Geruda has organs to use this energy like jet propulsion, spraying flames from its feet. Thus, it can fly through the air using the energy it emits. The Geruda deals damage to its opponents with its talons, which are more enormous than the Rio's, along with the blistering heat radiating from its skin.

The Geruda is Command Level III. It is a very tough enemy.

In the little time it takes to escape from the Holtz's range of movement, I also take two ramming attacks. <<if $items.includes("Varia ")>><span style="color:red">(-4 Energy)</span><<set $energy = $energy - 4>><<else>><span style="color:red">(-6 Energy)</span><<set $energy = $energy - 6>><</if>><<if $energy <1>><<set $energy = 0>><hr >GAME OVER<<linkreplace "GAME OVER ">><<goto "GAME OVER">><</linkreplace>><<else>>

Nevertheless, I am somehow able to run.

<img src="assets/images/Holtz.webp">The Holtz is an evolution of the Geruda. It doesn't have the Geruda's enormous talons, but it does have spikes growing on its body and swoops to attack, radiating temperatures even higher than the Geruda's. Its means of locomotion is the same as the Geruda, propelling itself with jets using the energy generated inside its body and freely flying about in mid-air. 

However, even though it's an evolution of the Geruda, its level and damage are different. If anything, instead of saying the Holtz evolved from the Geruda, it seems better to say that both are creatures with the same ancestor whose genes had already diverged.

'At the same moment, there is an enormous creature there. Its overall height is easily three meters. Its silhouette looks like an ancient dinosaur...except for the shadow of the enormous wings on its back...

'It's Ridley. 

The instant I realize this, I feel sharp a pain throughout my entire body. It's Ridley's attack. He breathes fire.

As the only creature that lived on the asteroid Zebes in the early days when this environment was uninhabitable (although now it has been improved by the Space Pirates), Ridley has psychic powers and the ability to fly. But now his mind is controlled by Mother Brain, and though he was originally docile, he has been transformed into a creature of indescribable cruelty. 

Ridley's flame attack is among his psionic abilities, so when I feel those flames, the pain he induces throughout my entire body all at once is incredible.

I wait near the energy tank and watch what happens. However, the Metroid Mutant doesn't intend to do things so slowly. While lying in wait observing, my position is revealed.

The Metroid Mutant has an attack method characteristic of the Metroids: grappling on to its victims and sucking away their energy...

[[Shoot at it->Shoot the Metroid Mutant]]
[[Run away->Run from the Metroid Mutant]]



:: Fight the Metroid Mutant {"position":"1100,5350","size":"100,100"}
The Metroid Mutant changes its attack. The creature has thick tentacles unlike those of the Metroids. However, the ends of its tentacles have sharpened, and it can damage its opponents with them. Metroids go for the abdomen'I avoid it.

However, right past where I was standing is the section of the engine I just performed emergency maintenance on. The creature's attack pierces the engine'it begins to run wild again.

Also, when the Metroid Mutant strikes the engine, it is exposed to a large dose of radiation. 

[[It gives a single cry and flees somewhere in the ship.->Engine Going Critical]]



:: Run from the Metroid Mutant {"position":"1225,5350","size":"100,100"}
The Metroid Mutant's attack slices through the air. I manage to avoid it by a hair's breadth. I keep attacking with the Ice Beam so I can restrain the creature and escape from the room. In any case, because my data on the Metroid Mutant is insufficient, for now it would probably be better to go back to the cockpit for awhile and come up with a battle plan. However, despite my efforts to restrain the Metroid Mutant, [[my enemy hasn't given up its attack.->A Monster Outside the Cockpit]]

Although the Metroid Mutant has found me inside the escape pod, it doesn't seem like it intends to kill me immediately. It seems to be enjoying itself.

Now, the Metroid Mutant is slowly coming closer. 

'Enjoying itself.

However, I won't stand for the thing's insolence.

<i >WHOOOOOoooSSSShhhh...</i >The atmospheric pressure inside the pod drops abruptly.

I have opened the airlock.

Of course, I've anchored my body in place.

The Metroid Mutant, not latched onto anything, is forcibly flung into space.

I close the airlock the moment the creature has been blown outside. 

[[However, I can't let my guard down just yet.]]

I flee. There might be some hope of being rescued, but I flee all the same. The Pirates' enormous spacecraft recovers over only the escape pod with the Metroid Mutant inside and speeds away leaving me behind undetected.

And so, I am left alone in the vastness of space. However, I need my ship's transmitter to call for help, not some simple communicator. The SOS broadcasting equipment attached to my space suit is truly no consolation.

I am fated die alone in the vastness of space.

Without stopping to think, I fire the Ice Beam. Instantly, the room fills with cold air. At first, the Ice Beam slows down the Metroid Mutant, but already the creature seems to be shrugging it off. The Metroid Mutant creeps forward slowly but steadily.

At that moment, a harsh voice rises from the ship's internal communication system: 'We have picked up your distress signal. You're much obliged!'

Displayed on the ship's external monitor is a pirate ship with an exquisite, old-fashioned skull and crossbones drawn on its hull. However, the Metroid Mutant has disappeared unnoticed, perhaps frightened off by the [[yelling.->Captured for Execution]]

In the space that opens when the crew stand there dumbfounded, I try to flee the room, but the Pirates are not to be taken so lightly. If it is simply a matter of power, my body has been modified by cyborg implants and has the strength of five ordinary men. However, since there are ten men pinning me down, I can't move even with my strength.

<i >CLANG, CLANG!!</i >Suddenly, an alarm blares through the room. 

'What's that?!' the boss nervously asks a nearby crewman.

'I don't know. We've gotten word that some kind of hellish creature is wandering about the ship. But since every person who has come across it's been killed, we don't have any accurate information!'

It's the Metroid Mutant...that thing is still on the prowl.

Even the Pirates surrounding me are ready to run.

However, I don't have my helmet on, and ultimately, the Ice Beam proves ineffective. A thick tentacle slams into me like a log and the impact sends me dancing into the air.

I stop when my back crashes into the wall. If the Metroid Mutant could express emotions, it would almost certainly be grinning broadly right now. However, thanks to being thrown back, the distance between me and the creature has made it possible for me to [[run for it.->Suddenly...]]

Well, I thought this might be a reckless way to settle things. Although this is an enormous spacecraft, the Missile's explosion blossoms suddenly within the narrow passage. And I don't have my helmet on.

Although the force of the Missile's explosion doesn't open a hole in the ship's outer hull, it is strong enough to produce a similar phenomenon to lighting gunpowder in a rifle barrel.

And so, having been engulfed in the explosion without a helmet, I am rendered immobile, with no means of opposing the Metroid Mutant.

And little wonder. I, their enemy, have offered to fight alongside them. And their dimwitted Boss, keeping his voice calm, says, 'All right. Here, use this,' and hands over the Ice Beam he had taken from me.

The moment I equip the Ice Beam, a loud bang suddenly fills the room. The Metroid Mutant has already reached the outside of the control room and is unleashing its attack on the door. The Pirates have also finished preparing for battle. The door is opened by remote.

On the other side of the open door is...the Metroid Mutant.

Since my Ice Beam wasn't effective against the creature, it doesn't seem like these will be very effective, either. However, through the Pirates'force of will and determination, or perhaps merely by sheer numbers and their vast quantity of guns, the lasers are definitely damaging the Metroid Mutant. However, the Pirates are also falling one by one.

I come up with of a strategy. If most of the Pirates die in the battle, it might be possible to safely escape after recovering the capsule. I steel myself and allow the Pirates to become the Metroid Mutant's victims...

Though most of the pirates have fallen, the Metroid Mutant is also taking considerable damage. So, to make doubly sure, I fire a Missile into the creature!

I don't let this chance escape.

However, when the authorities came to investigate, although they discovered an enormous impact crater, in the end, the meteor itself was never found.

A mysterious corpse was discovered at yesterday's meteorite impact in Austin, Nevada. It was found to be the body of Mr. Terry Gilliam, 45, the owner of a private ranch in Austin. The corpse, which had no external wounds, was wrinkled as all the fluids had been sucked out of it, and had been disfigured to resemble a frail old man.

That same day, Mr. Gilliam, an eyewitness to the meteorite impact, rushed out of his home screaming, 'The meteor! The meteor!,' and never returned. 

The authorities speculated whether an unknown pathogen had clung to the meteor, prompting criticism from the neighborhood's residents.

I somehow manage to escape the Dessgeega. I fake going to the right, but fire my boosters at the last minute and quickly dash behind it. However, in the process, I am dealt a parting blow. <<if $items.includes("Varia ")>><span style="color:red">(-3 Energy)</span><<set $energy = $energy - 3>><<else>><span style="color:red">(-4 Energy)</span><<set $energy = $energy - 4>><</if>><<if $energy <1>><<set $energy = 0>><hr >GAME OVER<<linkreplace "GAME OVER ">><<goto "GAME OVER">><</linkreplace>><<else>>

My attempt to escape the Dessgeega fails. I try to fake a move to the left, and suddenly turn right, but the Dessgeega is too fast and blocks my way.

Attack successful! The enemy's movements are quick, and although it gives you some trouble, you are somehow able to beat it. The creature screams a single shriek through the air.
